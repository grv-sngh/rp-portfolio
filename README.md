# RealPython-portfolio

Learning Django by building personal portfolio project which I have been putting off for very long, almost a yeat and a half since the first inception of the idea of a django blog. I have been trying to get my hands on django, putting hours into learing it and making something out of it but it took me very long to get use to it and now I am back into, I am definitely completing it today and then will be finally starting off to maintain my personal blog and portfolio. This is my big task for today, the milestone I have to reach in order to get done with this once and for all.
